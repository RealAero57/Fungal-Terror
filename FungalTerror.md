"Sir, we are detecting high energy signatures off the coast of Syldavia,"
"What?!"
"Yes sir, it is growing powerful by the second"

</br>

<h3 align="center"><b>Meanwhile in Syldavia</b></h3>

</br>

What appears to be a piece of the sky is falling down. "Boom!" a loud noise is heard and a giant mushroom cloud is formed, changing its colour from black to pink to violet. There is a large wave of dust; however, no signs of damage were detected.

"Sir the energy signature spiked and is now at zero"
"What? What could this be? A weapon? A Metoeri—"
"Sir, the energy signature is similar to the mysterious asteroid thirty years ago, floating near Pluto"
"The asteroid? But how could that crash? It wasn’t supposed to do anything. It was deemed safe by NASA, for crying out loud!"
"Sir, there are gravity anomalies around the now christened crash site. It is as if gravity is going haywire at some of the spots for short periods. Sometimes weaker, sometimes stronger, sometimes—due to the lack of a better phrase—turned off"
"God damn! That is peculiar! Send a message to the European Union, to all military bases around the US, to the President, to Syldavia!"
"Yes sir!"
There are noises of keyboards clacking, and noises that sound like Morse code.

"Send an army regiment now. Get the choppers ready. And, and, what was that, yes, get the F-16s ready too. And diplomats too"
"Yes sir!"
"NOW!"
"on it, sir!"
An regiment of about 250 people march (in unison), sounding like herd a elephants walking.

"At last we are here" said a tall, fair-skinned, blonde-haired, teenager, Oliver.
"Yes, Ollie. The mountain air smells good!" A tall slender, red haired, teenager, Chloe, exclaimed. "I suppose" she added, in a doubtful manner.
"At last I am on top. Just so you know, trekking isn’t easy." Said an out-of-breathe, fair skinned, red-cheeked, brown haired, fat teenager said. "Let’s trek they said. It’ll be fun they said"
Oliver flinched. He takes out his survival knife and points it at the fat teenager from earlier.
Oliver sighs. "It’s just you Andy," he said. "I got scared. Sorry for waving the knife at you"
"No problem, Ollie" Andy says.
Oliver puts his knife back.
